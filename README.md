In this tutorial (https://lnkd.in/ehJGx_YB), I walk through how I developed an AI agent that can process, clean, and consolidate CSV files automatically. This project combines concepts I learned from Coursera's "AI Agents and Agentic AI with Python & Generative AI" courses.
What it does: 
- Navigate to specific directories
- List and identify CSV files
- Read and analyze file contents
- Clean up messy data
- Consolidate multiple files into one
You just chat with it naturally! This is the link to Github repo for the agent.
